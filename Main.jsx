        Fancy goldfish are interesting, fun additions to many tanks or ponds.
        However, they all have their own special needs and they can’t be kept
        with just any tank mates. It’s important to ensure you carefully choose
        tank mates for your fancies so avoid injury and stress. Some of them are
        weak swimmers or have poor vision, meaning they can easily be out
        competed for food and may not be able to escape bullying by other fish.
        Many fancies are becoming more popular in the aquatics trade, while
        others are rare enough that you may never see them in person. Each breed
        of fancy goldfish has its own charm and unique qualities, making them
        beautiful centerpieces for your tank.
